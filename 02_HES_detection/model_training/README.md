# Model training

Initially, we used the code provided in the repository. 

Usage is straightforward. After installing requirements from the project root:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can freely use a notepad.

Due to poor performance, we switched to **YOLOv8**  [Python SDK](https://github.com/hero/YOLOv8). We trained it according to the instructions in the repository.

Note: I am not the author of the code in the module. It is provided for contextual purposes only.
