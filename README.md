# About me

I'm a software developer specialized in AI/ML and computer vision. I have over two years of commercial experience and around five years of academic experience in related fields.

I hold a degree in Mechatronics (specialization: Photonics) from Warsaw University of Technology and I'm currently completing a Master's in Information Technology (also at WUT). During my studies, I’ve focused on deepening my core interests — machine vision and AI, while also exploring how to apply them across different problem domains.

# About this repository

This repository showcases a selection of non-commercial projects I’ve worked on during my academic and personal development. The projects are ordered (in my opinion) from the most relevant and technically impactful to more exploratory ones.
